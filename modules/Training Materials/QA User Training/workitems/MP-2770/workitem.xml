    <field id="description" text-type="text/html"><![CDATA[Most organizations are testing their unit tests with special testing tools and need to generate some reports and statistics for their managers,<br/>
 Polarion delivers an importer which can handle a xUnit file output of such automated testing tools. 
<ul>
  <li>Create a new test run called &quot;auto_Product A&quot; and choose &quot;xUnit Test Manual Upload&quot; as template</li>
  <li>You will get a new test run which looks nearly like other test runs we already now. Use the &quot;Upload Results&quot; button to upload the file manually. Usually you would create a job which will import these files automatically.<br/>
    <img src="attachment:uploadResults.PNG" style="width: 211px;height: 146px;"/></li>
  <li>Use your selenium test results file  stored at <span id="WIKI_LINK:_default.Home|Home"></span>  to upload your results.</li>
  <li>After uploading your test report will be generated and all test cases and defects which are new will be created, Test cases which are already available will be updated.<br/>
    </li>
