<!-- 
  This is a configuration file for the "My Hats" feature. It defines how files 
  on the Work Item form are filtered for a "Hat" configuration. Any Hat can 
  have filtering of the Work Item form configured for it. Filtering hides some 
  fields, or sets some fields to read-only for different workflow actions and 
  states. Filtering is engaged when a user invokes "Show Minimal Fields" on the 
  Work Item form toolbar. It is not a mechanism for restricting access to 
  fields. It merely puts less frequently needed fields and editing capability 
  out of the user's way. Visibility and editing can be restored by the user any 
  time.
							
   The <formFilter> element specifies the visual and model filter to be used during processing of a work flow state or action to    
   hide unwanted fields and show important ones, and set read-only restrictions on fields to prevent accidental user modification.   
   Filtering can be disabled by users so that they can see (and edit) all fields, if they need this.   
    
   For specifing fields you can use special commands such as    
      @all - all fields of the current work item can be edited in the form                    
      @required - all required fields are marked in edited work item form with asterix.   

   For read only attribute you cannot use @required, only @all is applicable.       

   If you want to remove some field use the symbol: '-'.   
   If you want add some field use the symbol '+' or simply ommit the plus sign 
   and specify field directly.   
       
   There is no hierachical selecting of filters, simply what is inside of action 
   or state element, it used or no filter is applicable.    
       
   Work Item type-specific configuration can be enabled in the file: 
   [workItemType]-form-filter.xml

   For more information about user-specific configuration see comments in the 
   form-layout.xml file in this folder.
