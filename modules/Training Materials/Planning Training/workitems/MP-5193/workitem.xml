    <field id="description" text-type="text/html"><![CDATA[Our first iteration is finished and work which is still open needs to be moved into our next iteration. Work which is already finished should still be visible for a project manager so he always has a live state of his iteration.<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Open &quot;Iteration 3&quot;</li>
  <li>Set &quot;Start Date&quot; (today), &quot;Due Date&quot; (in 2 weeks) and capacity (40)</li>
  <li>Add your second requirement which is not yet finished to &quot;Iteration 3&quot;</li>
  <li>Save Plan</li>
  <li>Check your moved requirement. Via your &quot;Planned In&quot; attribute you can always see in which iteration or release your requirement was planned.<br/>

</ul>
